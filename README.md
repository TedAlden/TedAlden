## About me

- I live in the South-East of England, and I'm a second-year Computer Science student at the [University of Sussex](https://www.sussex.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/courses/computer-science-mcomp).
- I'm working as an online tutor for [Kodland](https://www.kodland.org/) teaching several different Python courses.
- My favourite languages to write with at the moment are **Python**, **Java**, and **Javascript**.
- Right now, I'm learning React Native to expand my skillset.

## My projects

- Most of my projects are outside of GitHub and I plan to upload them here soon.
- My main project currently is a University assignment where I am making a clone of **The Settlers of Catan**.
