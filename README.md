## About me

- I'm currently living in South-East England, and I'm a second-year Computer Science student at the [University of Sussex](https://www.sussex.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/courses/computer-science-mcomp).
- I am currently working as an online tutor for [Kodland](https://www.kodland.org/) teaching several different Python courses.
- My favourite languages to write with at the moment are **Python**, **Java**, and **Javascript**.
- I am currently in the process learning React Native to expand my skillset!

## My projects

- Most of my projects are outside of GitHub and I plan to upload them here very soon!
- My main project currently is a University assignment where I am making a clone of **The Settlers of Catan**.
