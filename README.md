## About me

- I'm from the South Coast of England and a second-year student at the University of Sussex (Masters degree in Computer Science).
- Currently working as an online tutor for various Python courses.
- Aside from coding and studying, my main hobbies are to play games and lift weights!

## My projects

- My favourite languages to write with at the moment are `Python`, `Java`, and `Javascript`. I am currently in the process learning React Native to expand my palette a bit!

- Most of my projects are outside of Github and I plan to upload them here in the near future.

- Currently the main project I am working on is a University assignment to make a clone of **The Settlers of Catan**.
