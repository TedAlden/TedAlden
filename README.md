## About me

- I'm from the South Coast of England and a second-year student at the University of Sussex studying a Masters degree in Computer Science.
- I am currently working as an online tutor for [Kodland](https://www.kodland.org/) teaching several different Python courses.

## My projects

- My favourite languages to write with at the moment are `Python`, `Java`, and `Javascript`. I am currently in the process learning React Native to expand my skillset!
- Most of my projects are outside of Github and I plan to upload them here in the near future.
- The main project I am working on right now is a University assignment where I am making a clone of **The Settlers of Catan**.
