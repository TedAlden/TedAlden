## About me

- I'm from the South Coast of England and a student at the University of Sussex.
- In my second year of a Masters degree in Computer Science.
- Currently working as an online tutor for various Python courses.
- My favourite languages to write with are `Python`, `Java`, and `Javascript`, and I am currently in the process learning React Native to expand a bit!

## My projects

Most of my projects are outside of Github and I plan to upload them here in the near future. Currently the main project I am working on is a University assignment to make a clone of **The Settlers of Catan**.
